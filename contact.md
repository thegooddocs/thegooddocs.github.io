### Email Lists
Email lists are our primary form of communication. How to join and archives are linked from:

* [Main list](https://thegooddocsproject.groups.io/g/main): Development discussion.
* [Announcements](https://thegooddocsproject.groups.io/g/announce): Announcements about releases and key events. (Typically monthly).

Why do we prefer email lists?

* They are archived.
* They work well for people working across multiple timezones and work patterns.

### Slack

We use Slack for informal discussions that would be of no interest to the wider audience. You are welcome to join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/enQtODkyNjI5MDc0NjE0LTUyNGFiZmU1MjIzNDMwN2E3NmQwODQwZmRkYWI5MDhlMzdjYzg4Nzg4YjM3ODA0NGE4MTgyYzdkMGViMTI2MDM).

### Real-time conference calls

As of 2019/2020 we have been holding weekly half-hour video conference calls. The timeslot often changes. Reach out to us to get an invitation. All interested in contributing are welcome.

### Code of Conduct

We are nice to each other, in line with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/governance/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md).

### Who are we?

We are a bunch of technical writers, educators, product developers and power users who also write. Some of us have big titles in large organisations; others donâ€™t. We are committed to helping others write great documentation through this project.

People on our Project Steering Committee are listed [here](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/governance/blob/master/ProjectSteeringCommittee.md).
